# Libboard: a vector graphics C++ library

## The LibBoard C++ library

#### Purpose

The LibBoard C++ library allows the drawing of Postscript, SVG, and FIG (XFig)
vector graphics using the C++ programming language.

It is suitable for adding SVG/EPS/FIG output support to a program; but also for
drawing graphics that involve a large (huge?) number of primitives. In the
latter case, one can indeed use loops, variables, functions and all C++
features. Produced files may afterwards be edited using dedicated tools.

### Features


For now, LibBoard can handle primitives like lines, rectangles, triangles, polylines, circles, ellipses, bitmap images and text. See the [TODO](TODO) file for a list of features that should be added in future releases.

### Documentation

 * See the Doxygen-made [documentation](https://foureys.users.greyc.fr/board/doc/0.9.5/).
